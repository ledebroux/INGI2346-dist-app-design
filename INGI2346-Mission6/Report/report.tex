%Write a narrative describing how you went about writing and testing each program you write. The narrative should describe what choices you faced and which you made. We should get a pretty good sense of what your program looks like from reading the narrative. So far as testing goes, describe how you went about choosing your test cases, what they were, and their results.

\section{Reasoning for the implementation of the algorithm}

\section{Discussion of the problems involved in the use of the groups of processes}

\section{The source code directory and instruction for building the executable files}
In the \verb@code@ folder, here are the files you can find : 
\begin{description}
\item[config] Contains the initial configuration for the \verb@pvm@ process. Here it contains only the path to the executables, for any machines names. It avoids to have to place the executables in the \verb@PVM_ARCH@ directory of the \verb@pvm@ directory.
\item[election.c] Contains the code for the main tasks that will create the different \verb@pvm@ tasks associated with each node and compute the \verb@diameter@ of the graph. More practically, it parses the input graph, then creates the pvm tasks associated to each node, compute the diameter ans makes the nodes aware of the others nodes they can reach.
\item[node.c] Contains the code for the different nodes of the graph : first the node are created, then they start the election algorithm.
\end{description}

To build the executable files, please execute the \verb@makefile@ that you can find at the root of the directory (\verb@./make@). The \verb@makefile@ compiles \verb@election.c@ and \verb@node.c@.\\

To try the program, please launch \verb@./make@, then start \verb@pvm@ with the \verb@config@ file (\verb@pvm config@). Please modify the \verb@config@ file by replacing the path to the \verb@code@ folder to yours.

\section{Commented listings of the programs}
Here are all the files for the election protocol to work.
